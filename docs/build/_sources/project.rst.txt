Project scope
=============

A formal representation of Esperanto's grammar
----------------------------------------------

This project comes from the question: *which could be the best natural
language for vocal interaction between humans and computers*?

`Esperanto <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto>`__
was therefore considered, an artificial language officially
born in 1887 for pleasure and thanks to the work of Polish Doctor
`Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof>`__,
a passionate linguistics studier that wanted to develop a language purely
international. From this, Esperanto was adopted by a significant
community of speakers in all the world really able to maintain a serious conversation
in this language.
The choice of Esperanto was thanks simplicity and regularity of
its grammar that could makes easier for computing systems to manage
the structure of the language.

The project "Ontology of Esperanto" is proposed as one of the first
attempts to produce a formal representation of a *non formal* language
(natural language), based on the Semantic Web standards.

The goal was to develop an ontology usable into NLP software
tools that can make easy a computer understand the logical form of varying
complexity phrases expressed in Esperanto.
From here we can imagine a scenario which on the Semantic
Web becomes available innovative services that allow users perform
queries in natural language for accessing data and documents, without having any expertise
in formal query languages.

The OWL-DL ontology of Esperanto
--------------------------------

Ontology is written in OWL-DL, a version of the language recommended
by the W3C for the Semantic Web, using Protégé, the ontology editor
developed by the University of Stanford (US), that uses the
automated reasoning services of Racer, the semantic reasoner developed by
the University of Luebeck (D).

The ontology verily are three: first for
the *grammar analysis*, second for the *logical analysis* and thitd for the
*analysis of the sentence*, where the highest level ontology refers to
concepts at lower levels.
In this way, once the various parts of the
text is qualified at lower levels, so the higher levels can be automatically
inferred.
